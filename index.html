        <div class="starter-text">
            <p>Living in Paris can be quite an adventure. Sometimes you get robbed in the subway, sometimes a pigeon flies in your face, and sometimes you discover there is a mouse in your trash. Don't panic, it could be worse, it could be a rat!</p>
            <p>All you have to do is catch it, and maybe after all, a new adventure could start, think about Ratatouille!
